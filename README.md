This project is integration of [loadforecast](https://github.com/MarekWadinger/loadforecast) an automatic time 
series forecasting procedure of an electrical load based on 
[prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) and [pyod](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) anomaly detection toolkit 
into user-friendly web app environment of [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit). 

It serves for automation of whole procedure of electrical load forecasting, making it fast and easy to use for both
